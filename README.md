# FindMyWard ðŸ”Ž

The concept is simply that of a meetup app. Honestly, if we had phones this won't be necessary at all ðŸ‘€

## Procedure
1. Student signs in with school provided gmail account or microsoft account. (admin accounts a work in progress)
2. On sign up, go to status page, in there student is asked to fill in information(name, gender and name of parents with phone number)
3. After filling of information, student is assigned to a location.
4. At the admin's convenience, admin user can login and navigate to admin dashboard, where global notifications for registered students can be sent.
5. Email is up but we are aware SMS will be key. To be added later.


## Notes
- Sometimes sending emails may fail or take time. A function will be provided to take note of this. However better performance will cost
- Student login only works with **school provided accounts**, this might not be ideal.
- Creation of an Admin account will be automatic. This will occur on initial database migration. Then a register function for additional admin accounts.
These will be the only local login accounts.

- A google map function is currently up, it could be sent to parents but i'm not willing to figure that out yet ðŸ˜¬
